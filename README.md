👋 About Me

Hi, my name is Adil.
I am a developer passionate about programming and game development.

I work with:

C++

C# (Unity)

Python

JavaScript

I am especially interested in systems programming, game mechanics, and procedural logic.
My goal is to become a professional developer, work in a large tech company one day, and build games that people truly enjoy.

This project is part of my journey to becoming a stronger developer and understanding real production workflows.

🎮 The Game

Human Factor is a judgment simulator inspired by games like Papers, Please and JudgeSim(Peace Death in the most).

In this game, the player takes the role of a supernatural judge who decides the fate of souls after death.

Each soul:

Has a procedurally generated biography

Contains moral choices and hidden traits

Requires analysis before making a final decision

Core features:

🎲 Randomized soul generation

📖 Dynamic biographies

⚖️ Moral decision system

🔁 Replayability

🎭 Animated transitions and scene control

The goal of the project was to:

Design a reusable character generation system

Implement UI state management

Handle animations and transitions properly

Structure Unity scripts cleanly

🚀 Conclusion

This project represents my minimum viable product (MVP) stage.
It proves that I can design, structure, and complete a playable game system independently.

While the game can be expanded with:

Deeper morality scoring

Persistent progression system

Story branching

Better visual polish

It already demonstrates:

Game logic architecture

Random generation systems

UI management

Player interaction handling

Clean code structuring

This is only the beginning.

More systems, better mechanics, and larger projects are coming.
